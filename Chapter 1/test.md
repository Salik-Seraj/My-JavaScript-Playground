**10 Lines to Teach You Bash Basics**

Here are 10 lines of Bash code to get you started:

1. **Echo:** `echo "Hello, world!"` (Prints "Hello, world!")
2. **Variables:** `name="Alice"` (Creates a variable named "name" with the value "Alice")
3. **Variable usage:** `echo "My name is $name"` (Prints "My name is Alice")
4. **Comments:** `# This is a comment` (Ignored by the interpreter)
5. **Conditional statements:** `if [ "$name" = "Alice" ]; then echo "Hi, Alice!" fi` (Checks if "name" is "Alice" and prints a message)
6. **Loops:** `for i in 1 2 3; do echo $i; done` (Loops 3 times, printing numbers 1, 2, and 3)
7. **Functions:** `function greet() { echo "Hello!"; }` (Defines a function named "greet")
8. **Function call:** `greet` (Calls the "greet" function)
9. **Piping:** `ls -l | grep "txt"` (Lists files, then filters for files ending in ".txt")
10. **Redirection:** `ls -l > files.txt` (Redirects the output of "ls -l" to a file named "files.txt")

These lines cover essential Bash concepts like variables, control flow, functions, and I/O operations. Experiment with them and explore the vast possibilities of Bash scripting!
